# installations
I got tired of having to look up how to install various tools and prereqs. Sometimes you need something that isn't in a docker container, or for some reason need it locally.

## Repository setup
Each tool has its own directory with a README.md with instructions on how to go about installing the associated tool. 

## Tool install directions in the repository


```
python3.6+
Mash
DOCKER CE
BaseMount
```
