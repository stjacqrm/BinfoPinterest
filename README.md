# installations
I got tired of having to look up how to install various tools and prereqs. Sometimes you need something that isn't in a docker container, or for some reason need it locally.

## Repository setup
#### Each tool has its own directory with a README.md with instructions on how to go about installing the associated tool. 
##### There are little READMEs in appropriately named directories with tips for running the tools. Check out the [docker](https://github.com/stjacqrm/installations/tree/master/DOCKER_CE) example if you're curious. 

## Tool install directions in the repository

  * python3.6+
  * Mash
  * DOCKER CE
  * BaseMount
  * linux_essentials
